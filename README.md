# PacMenExercise

In this MIT Development course exercise, we can create Pac Men that moves accross the screen and allow the users to add additional Pac Men. A button allows you to "Add PacMan"
allow you to add additional Pac Man, beofre or after clicking the "Start" button which will make the Pac Man move accross the screen. 

## How to run

Make sure the images PacMan1.png/PacMan2.png/PacMan3.png/PacMan4.png and the pacmen.js file are in the same directory of the PacMan_Exercise.html file. Launch/open the pacman.html document in your browser and click on "Add PacMan" and "Start" buttons. By clicking again on the "Start" button, the velocity of the PacMen(s) will increase. Notice : if you create too much PacMens and increase velocity, it can slow down your computer. 

## Roadmap of future improvements

Control a random PacMen via the keyboard. With a "control" button, the script will randomly put a PacMen, put it in the center and the control by the user will begin
upon keyboard touch (up, down, left, right).
